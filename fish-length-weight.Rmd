Make a function for fish weight.
```{r}
fish_weight <- function(a, b, L) {
  (a * L)^b
}

```

Use fish_weight to find different fish weights.
```{r}
# Milkfish weight
fish_weight(a = 0.0905, b = 2.52, L = 70)

#Giant trevally weight
fish_weight(a = 0.0353, b = 3.05, L = 70)

#Giant Barracuda weight
fish_weight(a = 0.0181, b = 3.27, L = 60)
```

Make a sequence for fish length.
```{r}
# 0 to 200 centimeters by increments of 1cm

fish_length <- seq(from = 0, to = 200, by = 1)
```

Barracuda weight along length range.
```{r}
barracuda_weight <- fish_weight(a = 0.0181, b = 3.27, L = fish_length)
```

Bind barracuda weights with fish length into a dataframe
```{r}
barracuda_df <- data.frame(fish_length, barracuda_weight)
```

Plot barracuda lengths vs. weights.
```{r}
ggplot(data = barracuda_df, mapping = aes(x = fish_length, y = barracuda_weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Barracuda Length (cm)",
       y = "Barracuda Weight (grams)",
       title = "Barracuda Expected Weight vs. Length",
       subtitle = "ooooh barracuda!")
```
